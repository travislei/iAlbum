# Overview
A simple web album using Node.js, Express.js and Angular.


# Implementation Details

## Assumptions
1. The maximum photo size is limited to 10MB, defined in `bodyParser` in `app.js`.

## Photo Name
Each uploaded photo has a filename generated by a UUIDv4 function.

## Photo Upload
The selected photo will be sent via `JSON` encoded in `base64`. Therefore the `bodyParser` is still used in parsing the `POST/uploadphoto` request.
